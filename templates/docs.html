        <h1>How It Works</h1>
        <p>Our Misinformation Detector discriminates between real and fake news using a machine learning pipeline
            trained on a dataset of over 40,000 articles.</p>

        <h2>The Dataset</h2>
        <p>The model was trained on the <strong>ISOT Fake News Dataset</strong>, which contains both reliable news
            articles obtained from Reuters and unreliable fabricated news. This diverse collection allows the model to
            learn linguistic patterns associated with credible reporting versus deceptive writing.</p>

        <h2>Preprocessing</h2>
        <p>Before analysis, the input text undergoes a rigorous preprocessing pipeline to prepare it for the machine
            learning model. First, we perform tokenization and cleaning to break down the text into linguistic units. We
            then remove "stopwords"—common words like "the", "is", and "at" which carry little semantic meaning but
            appear frequently. Finally, we convert the text into numerical vectors using <strong>TF-IDF (Term
                Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)</strong>. This technique weighs terms based on their importance,
            normalizing against how often they appear across the entire dataset to highlight unique, rigorous keywords.
        </p>

        <h2>The Algorithm</h2>
        <p>We use a <strong>Passive Aggressive Classifier</strong>, an online learning algorithm that is particularly
            effective for large-scale text classification tasks. The algorithm derives its name from its update
            strategy: it remains "passive" when it correctly classifies an input, making no changes to its internal
            model. However, it turns "aggressive" when a misclassification occurs, significantly adjusting its weight
            vector to correct the error. This approach allows the model to learn continuously and robustly, adapting
            quickly to new patterns of misinformation.</p>

        <h2>Accuracy</h2>
        <p>During extensive testing and validation, this model demonstrated robust performance, achieving an accuracy of
            approximately <strong>99%</strong> on the held-out test set. This high level of precision makes it a
            reliable tool for initial credibility screening of news content.</p>
